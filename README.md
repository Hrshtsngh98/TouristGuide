This application “Tourist Guide” serves a simple purpose of showing the tourist spots of the city that a tourist wants and makes it easy for him to explore locations such as museums, tourist attractions, amusement parks etc., around.

It shows detailed information about each and every tourist location like Near place, Map, Direction, location information. It also shows place address, timing for visits. Recent pics of the place to be shown when we click on location details. It also helps you by showing map to reach at that location from your current location through Google Map. Also the app shows the weather condition for the place that tourist wants.

When the application is started there is a user login and an ability to skip the login. After the user is done with login, there is another activity which shows map with the current location and search bar for the city. After selecting the city, a new activity opens with the categorization based on the type of place (Restaurant, Tourist Attraction, Amusement park etc.) A user can select the category and the list of places is displayed sorted on the nearest to farthest. On clicking the location, a user can see the details about the location and public reviews and a small picture of the place. On selecting the position, the app will show directions to the selected location.
